<h1>A guide to Structure</h1>

<p class="first"><em>Structure</em> was originally created to be a structurally-sound blogging theme. Over time, it became a mess to handle, but the backbone of the theme was still there.  This version is a return to its roots.</p>

<p class="second">The original theme was the foundation for the <em>Hybrid</em> theme framework.  So, it only makes sense that this theme gets to live on as a child theme of that framework.  The purpose of the <em>Structure</em> theme is to be a visually stunning theme through its pixel-perfect layout and beautiful typography.</p>

<h2>How to install Structure</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme">Hybrid theme</a> first. This is required to run the <em>Structure</em> child theme.</li>
	<li>Unzip the <code>structure.zip</code> file (you've probably already done this).</li>
	<li>Upload the <code>structure</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/themes</code> directory.</li>
	<li>Go to <em>Appearance > Themes</em> in your WordPress admin.</li>
	<li>Activate the <em>Structure</em> theme.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the theme</h2>

<p>The theme is a child theme for the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme">Hybrid theme framework</a>, which means you must have <em>Hybrid</em> installed to use <em>Structure</em>.  Don't worry.  Just because it uses a framework doesn't mean it's complicated.  It just means that your site will be a lot more powerful and all you have to do is have <em>Hybrid</em> installed.</p>

<p>Everything should work from the moment you have everything installed.  Since the theme relies heavily on thumbnails, it might be helpful to read up on <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid/images" title="How images work in Hybrid">how images work</a> within the <em>Hybrid</em> framework.</p>

<h2>Widgets</h2>

<p>In addition to the <em>Hybrid</em> theme's widget areas, <em>Structure</em> introduces one additional place to house your widgets.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Utility: Header</strong><br />
	This widget area is placed to the right of your header area.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Theme Support &amp; Community</h2>

<p>The most authoritative sources for finding out how to use the theme or do some nifty stuff are the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/structure" title="Structure WordPress theme">Structure</a> and <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme">Hybrid</a> theme tutorials.
